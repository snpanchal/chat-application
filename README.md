# chat-application

This is a chat application I created to learn about building complex applications with multiple systems. For example, this app itself has many screens and background services. It works with a fully-implemented back-end on Firebase, a login system, and a few cloud functions (also on Firebase)  to manage notifications and friend requests.

To use this app, the user must first sign up. They can then search any other user on the app and send them a friend request. After the other user has accepted the friend request, the two users can start a conversation between them. The app will also send push notifications to a user when they have received a message from someone.
